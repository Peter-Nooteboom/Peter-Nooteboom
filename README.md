### 👋: Hi, my name is Peter Nooteboom

🎓 : Ph.D. student in Health & Quantitative Psychology from UCLA (Graduating June 2022). I have also earned a Masters in Health & Quantitive Psychology, and a Bachelors in Psychology, both from UCLA.

📍: Los Angeles Native, with a passion for answering hard questions and solving practical business problems through the use of data.

📚 : As a graduate student my research focused primarily on the impact of digital-based social relationships on health outcomes for individuals with chronic illnesses. I have gone on to use data-driven decision making at Gali Health to help develop an AI chatbot focused on helping support patients with chronic illness. Additionally, at Hack for LA I helped create a platform for visualizing Los Angeles parking data through the use of data cleaning, analysis, and feature creation. Currently at AppliedVR, I am using data analysis and modeling to help innovate and approve virtual reality therapeutic products.

🏔 : Moving forward I plan to analyze interesting data and create impactful data models to help solve business problems and answer important questions. I have particular interest in applying my skills in the fields of digital health and technology.
