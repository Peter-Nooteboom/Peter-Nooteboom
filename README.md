Hello! My name is Peter Nooteboom 👋🏽

I have 10+ years of experience managing and analyzing data, and nearly 4 years of experience applying my data science skills to help companies generate insights that drive innovation in digital health-related products. I have my Ph.D. in Health & Quantitative Psychology from UCLA. My experience has focused on leveraging quantitative analysis, product experimentation, data modeling, and machine learning to understand health and user behavior processes, and leverage those insights to inform the creation and improvement of innovative products and digital platforms.

Here you will find several of my data science projects applying machine learning and statistical modeling to answer interesting questions and solve valueble problems.
