Hello! My name is Peter Nooteboom 👋🏽

I have 10 years of experience managing and analyzing data, and 2 years of experience applying my data science skills to help companies generate insights that drive innovation in digital and physical products. I am a Ph.D. candidate in Health & Quantitative Psychology at UCLA (Graduating June 2022). My experience has focused on leveraging quantitative analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning to understand health and social phenomena, and leverage those insights to inform the creation and improvement of innovative products and digital health platforms.

Here you will find several of my data science projects applying machine learning and statistical modeling to answer interesting questions and solve valueble problems.
